The basic idea of the Game Prototype is to have a Destroyer equipped with:

- One Gatling Turret for PD
- Two missile launchers
- Two beam weapons

The ideal case for the Game Prototype would be to have two Destroyers in a battle with each other using Fudge's Network ability for two players and an AI variant of the battle. The worst-case scenario is to have the Gatling Turret player-controlled to destroy incoming asteroids.
